	abstract = {Abstract
            Glaucoma drainage devices ({GDDs}) are prosthetic-treatment devices for treating primary open-angle glaucoma. Despite their effectiveness in reducing intraocular pressures ({IOP}), endothelial cell damage ({ECD}) is a commonly known side-effect. There have been different hypotheses regarding the reasons for {ECD} with one being an induced increase in shear on the corneal wall. A computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) model was used to investigate this hypothesis in silico. The Ahmed Glaucoma Valve ({AGV}) was selected as the subject of this study using an idealised 3D model of the anterior chamber with insertion angles and positions that are commonly used in clinical practice. It was found that a tube-cornea distance of 1.27 mm or greater does not result in a wall shear stress ({WSS}) above the limit where {ECD} could occur. Similarly, a tube-cornea angle of 45° or more was shown to be preferable. It was also found that the {ECD} region has an irregular shape, and the aqueous humour flow fluctuates at certain insertion angles and positions. This study shows that pathological amounts of {WSS} may occur as a result of certain {GDD} placements. Hence, it is imperative to consider the associated fluid force interactions when performing the {GDD} insertion procedure.},

	abstract = {The flow of aqueous humor ({AH}) in the human eye plays a key role in the process of transporting nutrients to the intraocular tissues and maintaining normal intraocular pressure. The pathogenesis of many ophthalmic diseases is also closely related to the flow of {AH}. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the mechanism of {AH} dynamics in the human eye. In this paper, we used image processing technology to denoise and segment the anterior segment optical coherence tomography ({AS}-{OCT}) images and established a geometric model based on the human eye. At the same time, a model of {AH} dynamics in the human eye based on the lattice Boltzmann ({LB}) method was proposed. Then, we simulated the {AH} flow in the human eye with different morphological structures and different physical properties and analyzed the factors that affect the {AH} flow, including the shape of anterior chamber ({AC}), the crypts of iris, the indentation of cornea, the permeability of trabecular meshwork ({TM}), the secretion rate of {AH}, and the viscosity of {AH}. The results showed that the changes in eye tissue morphological structures and physical properties would affect the flow of {AH}. For example, the maximum velocity of {AH} flow decreases with the increases in cornea deformation. When the distance of cornea indentation changes from 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm, the maximum velocity of {AH} reduces by 17\%. In the asymmetrical {AC}, the {AH} will form two different vortices. In the crypts of the iris, we found that the {AH} flow forms small vortices, a phenomenon that has not been reported in other papers. In addition, we found that the intraocular pressure ({IOP}) decreases with the increase of the {TM} permeability and increases with the increase of the {AH} secretion rate, and it is not sensitive to changes in the viscosity of {AH}.},

	abstract = {In the process of reproducing the state dynamics of parameter dependent distributed systems, data from physical measurements can be incorporated into the mathematical model to reduce the parameter uncertainty and, consequently, improve the state prediction. Such a data assimilation process must deal with the data and model misfit arising from experimental noise as well as model inaccuracies and uncertainties. In this work, we focus on the ensemble Kalman method ({EnKM}), a particle-based iterative regularization method designed for a posteriori analysis of time series. The method is gradient free and, like the ensemble Kalman filter ({EnKF}), relies on a sample of parameters or particle ensemble to identify the state that better reproduces the physical observations, while preserving the physics of the system as described by the best knowledge model. We consider systems described by parameterized parabolic partial differential equations and employ model order reduction techniques to generate surrogate models of different accuracy with uncertain parameters. Their use in combination with the {EnKM} involves the introduction of the model bias which constitutes a new source of systematic error. To mitigate its impact, an algorithm adjustment is proposed accounting for a prior estimation of the bias in the data. The resulting {RB}-{EnKM} is tested in different conditions, including different ensemble sizes and increasing levels of experimental noise. The results are compared to those obtained with the standard {EnKF} and with the unadjusted algorithm.},

	abstract = {Heat transfer in the human eyeball, a complex organ, is significantly influenced by various pathophysiological and external parameters. Particularly, heat transfer critically affects fluid behavior within the eye and ocular drug delivery processes. Overcoming the challenges of experimental analysis, this study introduces a comprehensive three‐dimensional mathematical and computational model to simulate the heat transfer in a realistic geometry. Our work includes an extensive sensitivity analysis to address uncertainties and delineate the impact of different variables on heat distribution in ocular tissues. To manage the model's complexity, we employed a very fast model reduction technique with certified sharp error bounds, ensuring computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Our results demonstrate remarkable consistency with experimental observations and align closely with existing numerical findings in the literature. Crucially, our findings underscore the significant role of blood flow and environmental conditions, particularly in the eye's internal tissues. Clinically, this model offers a promising tool for examining the temperature‐related effects of various therapeutic interventions on the eye. Such insights are invaluable for optimizing treatment strategies in ophthalmology.},

	abstract = {Schlemm’s canal ({SC}) is a ring structure responsible for maintaining ﬂuid homeostasis in the anterior chamber of the eye by draining aqueous humor ({AH}) from the trabecular meshwork ({TM}) into the collecting channel ({CC}). Obstruction of the {AH} ﬂow in this conventional pathway leads to an elevation of intraocular pressure in glaucoma, which is internationally recognized as the most common cause of blindness. Although there are obvious morphological differences between patients and healthy individuals, the {AH} drainage capacity of {SC} with speciﬁc parameters is diﬃcult to quantitatively evaluate due to the limitations of analyses or experimental technologies. In this paper, the {AH} ﬂow dynamic features under various {SC} morphological parameters are studied by numerical simulations of 3D models. The axis length of the {SC} cross-section and the level of openness are chosen as the main morphological factors according to the clinical data. The ﬂow features, including the velocity, streamline and wall shear stress, are analyzed. This study aimed not only to explore the feasibility of 3D numerical modeling in evaluating the {SC} drainage capacity, but also to reveal the relationship between {SC} morphological parameters and the dynamic features of {AH} drainage.},

	abstract = {This work aims at quantifying the effect of inherent uncertainties from cardiac output on the sensitivity of a human compliant arterial network response based on stochastic simulations of a reduced‐order pulse wave propagation model. A simple pulsatile output form is used to reproduce the most relevant cardiac features with a minimum number of parameters associated with left ventricle dynamics. Another source of significant uncertainty is the spatial heterogeneity of the aortic compliance, which plays a key role in the propagation and damping of pulse waves generated at each cardiac cycle. A continuous representation of the aortic stiffness in the form of a generic random field of prescribed spatial correlation is then considered. Making use of a stochastic sparse pseudospectral method, we investigate the sensitivity of the pulse pressure and waves reflection magnitude over the arterial tree with respect to the different model uncertainties. Results indicate that uncertainties related to the shape and magnitude of the prescribed inlet flow in the proximal aorta can lead to potent variation of both the mean value and standard deviation of blood flow velocity and pressure dynamics due to the interaction of different wave propagation and reflection features. Lack of accurate knowledge in the stiffness properties of the aorta, resulting in uncertainty in the pulse wave velocity in that region, strongly modifies the statistical response, with a global increase in the variability of the quantities of interest and a spatial redistribution of the regions of higher sensitivity. These results will provide some guidance in clinical data acquisition and future coupling of arterial pulse wave propagation reduced‐order model with more complex beating heart models.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Biomechanical stresses and strains can be simulated in the optic nerve head ({ONH}) using the ﬁnite element ({FE}) method, and various element types have been used. This study aims to investigate the effects of element type on the resulting {ONH} stresses and strains.
Methods: A single eye-speciﬁc model was constructed using 3D delineations of anatomic surfaces in a high-resolution, ﬂuorescent, 3D reconstruction of a human posterior eye, then meshed using our simple meshing algorithm at various densities using 4- and 10-noded tetrahedral elements, as well as 8- and 20-noded hexahedral elements. A mesh-free approach was used to assign heterogeneous, anisotropic, hyperelastic material properties to the lamina cribrosa, sclera and pia. The models were subjected to elevated {IOP} of 45 {mmHg} after pre-stressing from 0 to 10 {mmHg}, and solved in the open-source {FE} package Calculix; results were then interpreted in relation to computational time and simulation accuracy, using the quadratic hexahedral model as the reference standard.
Results: The 10-noded tetrahedral and 20R-noded hexahedral elements exhibited similar scleral canal and laminar deformations, as well as laminar and scleral stress and strain distributions; the quadratic tetrahedral models ran signiﬁcantly faster than the quadratic hexahedral models. The linear tetrahedral and hexahedral elements were stiffer compared to the quadratic element types, yielding much lower stresses and strains in the lamina cribrosa.
Conclusions: Prior studies have shown that 20-noded hexahedral elements yield the most accurate results in complex models. Results show that 10-noded tetrahedral elements yield very similar results to 20-noded hexahedral elements and so they can be used interchangeably, with signiﬁcantly lower computational time. Linear element types did not yield acceptable results.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a generic approach of a dynamical data-driven model-order reduction technique for three-dimensional fluid–structure interaction problems. A low-order continuous linear differential system is identified from snapshot solutions of a high-fidelity solver. The reduced-order model uses different ingredients, such as proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition and Tikhonov-based robust identification techniques. An interpolation method is used to predict the capsule dynamics for any values of the governing non-dimensional parameters that are not in the training database. Then a dynamical system is built from the predicted solution. Numerical evidence shows the ability of the reduced model to predict the time evolution of the capsule deformation from its initial state, whatever the parameter values. Accuracy and stability properties of the resulting low-order dynamical system are analysed numerically. The numerical experiments show very good agreement, measured in terms of modified Hausdorff distance between capsule solutions of the full-order and low-order models, in the case of both confined and unconfined flows. This work is a first milestone to move towards real-time simulation of fluid–structure problems, which can be extended to nonlinear low-order systems to account for strong material and flow nonlinearities. It is a valuable innovation tool for rapid design and for the development of innovative devices.},

	volume = {43},
	issn = {0146-0404},
	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: To compare intraocular pressure ({IOP}) measurements of the Ocular Blood Flow ({OBF}) pneumotonometer, Goldmann applanation tonometer, and Tono-Pen in eyes with normal corneas of various thicknesses.
{METHODS}: {IOP} was measured with an {OBF} pneumotonometer, Tono-Pen and Goldmann applanation tonometer in random order in 181 eyes with normal corneas. Central corneal thickness ({CCT}) was measured using an ultrasonic pachymeter after all {IOP} determinations had been made. Right and left eyes were analyzed separately for statistical purposes.
{RESULTS}: With all instruments, {IOP} varied with {CCT}, even though the variation in {IOP} was large. Readings with the {OBF} pneumotonometer showed a mean increase in {IOP} with increasing {CCT} of 0.28 mm Hg/10 microm, an increase of 0.23 mm Hg/10 microm with the Goldmann tonometer, and of 0.10 mm Hg/10 microm with the Tono-Pen. The {OBF} pneumotonometer consistently recorded comparatively higher {IOPs} than the other two instruments.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The Tono-Pen is least affected by {CCT} when used to measure {IOP} in eyes with normal corneas. The {OBF} pneumotonometer appears to be more affected by variation in {CCT} than the Goldmann tonometer. This is contrary to expectations, based on the mechanism of measurement of {IOP} of the {OBF} pneumotonometer.},

	abstract = {Treating retinal diseases to prevent sight loss is an increasingly important challenge. Thanks to the configuration of the eye, the retina can be examined relatively easily in situ. Owing to recent technological development in scanning devices, much progress has been made in understanding the structure of the retina and characterising retinal biomarkers. However, treatment options remain limited and are often of low efficiency and efficacy. In recent years, the concept of  in silico clinical trials ({ISCTs}) has been adopted by many pharmaceutical companies to optimise and accelerate the development of therapeutics. {ISCTs} rely on the use of mathematical models based on the physical and biochemical mechanisms underpinning a biological system. With appropriate simplifications and assumptions, one can generate computer simulations of various treatment regimens, new therapeutic molecules, delivery strategies and so forth, rapidly and at a fraction of the cost required for the equivalent experiments. Such simulations have the potential not only to hasten the development of therapies and strategies but also to optimise the use of existing therapeutics. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in in silico models of the retina for mathematicians, biomedical scientists and clinicians, highlighting the challenges to developing {ISCTs}. Throughout this paper, we highlight key findings from in silico models about the physiology of the retina in health and disease. We describe the main building blocks of {ISCTs} and identify challenges to developing {ISCTs} of retinal diseases.},

	abstract = {In this work, we describe the {CRIMSON} ({CardiovasculaR} Integrated Modelling and {SimulatiON}) software environment. {CRIMSON} provides a powerful, customizable and user-friendly system for performing three-dimensional and reduced-order computational haemodynamics studies via a pipeline which involves: 1) segmenting vascular structures from medical images; 2) constructing analytic arterial and venous geometric models; 3) performing finite element mesh generation; 4) designing, and 5) applying boundary conditions; 6) running incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of blood flow with fluid-structure interaction capabilities; and 7) post-processing and visualizing the results, including velocity, pressure and wall shear stress fields. A key aim of {CRIMSON} is to create a software environment that makes powerful computational haemodynamics tools accessible to a wide audience, including clinicians and students, both within our research laboratories and throughout the community. The overall philosophy is to leverage best-in-class open source standards for medical image processing, parallel flow computation, geometric solid modelling, data assimilation, and mesh generation. It is actively used by researchers in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia. It has been applied to numerous clinical problems; we illustrate applications of {CRIMSON} to real-world problems using examples ranging from pre-operative surgical planning to medical device design optimization.},

	abstract = {Reduced bases have been introduced for the approximation of parametrized {PDEs} in applications where many online queries are required. Their numerical efficiency for such problems has been theoretically confirmed in Binev et al. ({SIAM} J. Math. Anal. 43 (2011) 1457–1472) and {DeVore} et al. ( Constructive Approximation 37 (2013) 455–466), where it is shown that the reduced basis space Vn of dimension n, constructed by a certain greedy strategy, has approximation error similar to that of the optimal space associated to the Kolmogorov n-width of the solution manifold. The greedy construction of the reduced basis space is performed in an offline stage which requires at each step a maximization of the current error over the parameter space. For the purpose of numerical computation, this maximization is performed over a finite training set obtained through a discretization of the parameter domain. To guarantee a final approximation error ε for the space generated by the greedy algorithm requires in principle that the snapshots associated to this training set constitute an approximation net for the solution manifold with accuracy of order ε. Hence, the size of the training set is the ε covering number for M and this covering number typically behaves like exp(Cε−1/s) for some C{\textgreater} 0 when the solution manifold has n-width decay O(n−s). Thus, the shear size of the training set prohibits implementation of the algorithm when ε is small. The main result of this paper shows that, if one is willing to accept results which hold with high probability, rather than with certainty, then for a large class of relevant problems one may replace the fine discretization by a random training set of size polynomial in ε −1. Our proof of this fact is established by using inverse inequalities for polynomials in high dimensions.},

	abstract = {The context of this paper is the simulation of parameter-dependent partial differential equations ({PDEs}). When the aim is to solve such {PDEs} for a large number of parameter values, Reduced Basis Methods ({RBM}) are often used to reduce computational costs of a classical high fidelity code based on Finite Element Method ({FEM}), Finite Volume ({FVM}) or Spectral methods. The efficient implementation of most of these {RBM} requires to modify this high fidelity code, which cannot be done, for example in an industrial context if the high fidelity code is only accessible as a "black-box" solver. The Non-Intrusive Reduced Basis ({NIRB}) method has been introduced in the context of finite elements as a good alternative to reduce the implementation costs of these parameter-dependent problems. The method is efficient in other contexts than the {FEM} one, like with finite volume schemes, which are more often used in an industrial environment. In this case, some adaptations need to be done as the degrees of freedom in {FV} methods have different meanings. At this time, error estimates have only been studied with {FEM} solvers. In this paper, we present a generalisation of the {NIRB} method to Finite Volume schemes and we show that estimates established for {FEM} solvers also hold in the {FVM} setting. We first prove our results for the hybrid-Mimetic Finite Difference method ({hMFD}), which is part the Hybrid Mixed Mimetic methods ({HMM}) family. Then, we explain how these results apply more generally to other {FV} schemes. Some of them are specified, such as the Two Point Flux Approximation ({TPFA}).},

	url = {https://theses.hal.science/tel-01366885v1},
	abstract = {Numerous mucous membranes inside the human body are covered with cilia which, by their coordinated movements, lead to a circulation of the layer of fluid coating the mucous membrane, which allows, for example, in the case of the internal wall of the bronchi, the evacuation of the impurities inspired outside the respiratory system.In this thesis, we integrate the effects of the cilia on the fluid, at the scale of the cilium. For this, we consider the incompressible Stokes equations. Due to the very small thickness of the cilia, the direct computation would request a time-varying mesh grading around the cilia. To avoid too prohibitive computational costs, we consider the asymptotic of a zero diameter cilium with an infinite velocity: the cilium is modelled by a lineic Dirac of force in source term. In order to ease the computations, the lineic Dirac of forces can be approached by a sum of punctual Dirac masses distributed along the cilium. Thus, by linearity, we have switched our initial problem with the Stokes problem with a punctual force in source term. Thus, we simplify the computations, but the final problem is more singular than the initial problem. The loss of regularity involves a deeper numerical analysis and the development of a new method to solve the problem.We have first studied a scalar version of this problem: Poisson problem with a Dirac right-hand side. The exact solution is singular, therefore the finite element solution has to be defined with caution. In this case, the convergence is not as good as in the regular case, and thus we focused on local error estimates. We have proved a quasi-optimal convergence in H1-norm (s ď 1) on a sub-domain which does not contain the singularity. Similar results have been shown for the Stokes problem too.In order to recover an optimal convergence on the whole domain, we have developped a numerical method to solve elliptic problems with a Dirac mass or a punctual force in source term. It is based on the standard finite element method and the explicit knowl- edge of the singularity of the exact solution. Given the positions of the cilia and their parametrisations, this method permits to compute in 3d a very high number of cilia. We have applied this to the study of the mucociliary transport in the lung. This numerical tool gives us information we do not have with the experimentations and pathologies can be computed and studied by this way, like for example a small number of cilia.},

	abstract = {When looking into someone's eyes, we can easily see several structures (Fig. 1): A black-looking aperture, the pupil, that allows light to enter the eye (it appears dark because of the absorbing pigments in the retina). A colored circular muscle, the iris, which is beautifully pigmented and gives us our eye color (the central aperture of the iris is the pupil). This circular muscle controls the size of the pupil so that more or less light, depending on conditions, is allowed to enter the eye. Eye color, or more correctly, iris color, is due to variable amounts of eumelanin (brown/black melanins) and pheomelanin (red/yellow melanins) produced by melanocytes. More eumelanin is found in brown-eyed people, and more pheomelanin is found in blue- and green-eyed people. The melanocortin-1 receptor ({MC}1R) gene is a regulator of eumelanin production and is located on chromosome 16q24.3. Point mutations in the {MC}1R gene affect melanogenesis. The presence of point mutations in the {MC}1R gene alleles is a common feature in light-skinned and blue- and green-eyed people (1, 2). A transparent external surface, the cornea, that covers both the pupil and the iris. This is the first and most powerful lens of the optical system of the eye and allows, together with the crystalline lens, the production of a sharp image at the retinal photoreceptor level. The "white of the eye", the sclera, which forms part of the supporting wall of the eyeball. The sclera is continuous with the cornea. Furthermore, this external covering of the eye is in continuity with the dura of the central nervous system.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Laser ablation is a minimally invasive therapeutic technique to denature tumors through coagulation and/or vaporization. Computational simulations of laser ablation can evaluate treatment outcomes quantitatively and provide numerical indices to determine treatment conditions, thus accelerating the technique’s clinical application. These simulations involve calculations of light transport, thermal diffusion, and the extent of thermal damage. The optical properties of tissue, which govern light transport through the tissue, vary during heating, and this affects the treatment outcomes. Nevertheless, the optical properties in conventional simulations of coagulation and vaporization remain constant. Here, we propose a laser ablation simulation based on Monte Carlo light transport with a dynamic optical properties ({DOP}) model. The proposed simulation is validated by performing optical properties measurements and laser irradiation experiments on porcine liver tissue. The {DOP} model showed the replicability of the changes in tissue optical properties during heating. Furthermore, the proposed simulation estimated coagulation areas that were comparable to experimental results at low-power irradiation settings and provided more than 2.5 times higher accuracy when calculating coagulation and vaporization areas than simulations using static optical properties at high-power irradiation settings. Our results demonstrate the proposed simulation’s applicability to coagulation and vaporization region calculations in tissue for retrospectively evaluating the treatment effects of laser ablation.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a theoretical model leveraging the analogy between fluid and electric variables to investigate the relation among aqueous humor ({AH}) circulation and drainage and intraocular pressure ({IOP}), the principal established risk factor of severe neuropathologies of the optic nerve such as glaucoma. {IOP} is the steady-state result of the balance among {AH} secretion ({AHs}), circulation ({AHc}), and drainage ({AHd}). {AHs} are modeled as a given volumetric flow rate electrically corresponding to an input current source. {AHc} is modeled by the series of two linear hydraulic conductances ({HCs}) representing the posterior and anterior chambers. {AHd} is modeled by the parallel of three {HCs}: a linear {HC} for the conventional adaptive route ({ConvAR}), a nonlinear {HC} for the hydraulic component of the unconventional adaptive route ({UncAR}), and a nonlinear {HC} for the drug-dependent component of the {UncAR}. The proposed model is implemented in a computational virtual laboratory to study the value attained by the {IOP} under physiological and pathological conditions. Simulation results (i) confirm the conjecture that the {UncAR} acts as a relief valve under pathological conditions, (ii) indicate that the drug-dependent {AR} is the major opponent to {IOP} increase in the case of elevated trabecular meshwork resistance, and (iii) support the use of the model as a quantitative tool to complement in vivo studies and help design and optimize medications for ocular diseases.},

The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations—Galerkin projection onto a space {WN} spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation—relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp and rigorous bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound, depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control.},

	abstract = {Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce {MeshGraphNets}, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.},

It is shown that the error in an interior domain Ω can be estimated with the best order of accuracy that is possible locally for the subspaces used plus the error in a weaker norm over a slightly larger domain which measures the effects from outside of the domain Ω .

	abstract = {Heat and mass transport processes in humans occur at cellular, tissue, organ, and whole-body levels. The subﬁeld of heat and mass transfer in the human eye provides the context for understanding the functions of the eye and to develop protective, diagnostic, and therapeutic processes. The eye is sensitive to the environment because of the absence of blood ﬂow through parts such as cornea and lens, and the absence of thermal sensors and protective reﬂexes beyond blinking. Heat transfer processes in the eye comprise the continuous evaporation of the tear layer coating the corneal region of a normal eye, the thermal massage across the pupils called the transpupillary thermotherapy ({TTT}), and the several methods of internal tissue ablation involving lasers. Drug delivery inside the eye is an important man-made mass transfer process that includes the intravitreous and transscleral routes to medicate the retina. This chapter focuses on the exposition of heat transfer processes that drive laser surgical methods and the mass transfer processes that govern drug delivery methods to the retina. In a bridging section, discussion on the combined heat and mass transfer processes involved in the {TTT}-based convection-assisted drug diffusion to the retina through the vitreous humor is also provided.},

The severity and circumferential extent of angle closure were modeled by lowering the permeability of the outflow pathways. The {IOP} predicted by the model was compared with biometric and {IOP} data from the Chinese American Eye Study, wherein the circumferential extent of angle closure was determined using anterior segment {OCT} measurements of angle opening distance.    The mechanistic model predicted an initial linear rise in {IOP} with increasing extent of angle closure which became nonlinear when the extent of closure exceeded around one-half of the circumference. The nonlinear rise in {IOP} was associated with a nonlinear increase in {AH} outflow velocity in the open regions of the angle. These predictions were consistent with the nonlinear relationship between angle closure and {IOP} observed in the clinical data.    {IOP} increases rapidly when the circumferential extent of angle closure exceeds 180°. Residual {AH} outflow may explain why not all angle closure eyes develop elevated {IOP} when angle closure is extensive.    This study provides insight into the extent of angle closure that is clinically relevant and confers increased risk of elevated {IOP}. The proposed model can be utilized to study other mechanisms of impaired aqueous outflow.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose a computational framework to estimate the physical properties that govern the thermal response of laser-irradiated tissue. We focus in particular on two quantities, the absorption and scattering coefficients, which describe the optical absorption of light in the tissue and whose knowledge is vital to correctly plan medical laser treatments. To perform the estimation, we utilize an implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter ({EnKF}), a type of Bayesian filtering algorithm for data assimilation. Unlike prior approaches, in this work, we estimate the tissue optical properties based on observations of the tissue thermal response to laser irradiation. This method has the potential for straightforward implementation in a clinical setup, as it would only require a simple thermal sensor, for example, a miniaturized infrared camera. Because the optical properties of tissue can undergo shifts during laser exposure, we employ a variant of {EnKF} capable of tracking time-varying parameters. Through simulated experimental studies, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to identify the tissue optical properties and track their dynamic changes during laser exposure, while simultaneously tracking changes in the tissue temperature at locations beneath the surface. We further demonstrate the framework's capability in estimating additional unknown tissue properties (i.e., the volumetric heat capacity and thermal conductivity) along with the optical properties of interest.},

In this article, we address the numerical analysis of the finite element method for the Laplace equation with Dirac source term: we consider, in dimension 3, the Dirac measure along a curve and, in dimension 2, the punctual Dirac measure. The study of this problem is motivated by the use of the Dirac measure as a reduced model in physical problems, for which high accuracy of the finite element method at the singularity is not required. We show a quasioptimal convergence in the Hs‐norm, for s{\textgreater}=1 on subdomains which exclude the singularity; in the particular case of Lagrange finite elements, an optimal convergence in H1‐norm is shown on a family of quasiuniform meshes. Our results are obtained using local Nitsche and Schatz‐type error estimates, a weak version of Aubin‐Nitsche duality lemma and a discrete inf‐sup condition. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical illustrations.},

	abstract = {There are a lot of geometrical and morphological changes that happen in the human eye with age. Primary openangle glaucoma, which is caused by the increase in intraocular pressure inside the anterior chamber of the eye is also associated with the physiological aging of the eye. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effects of aging on drug delivery in the human eye when applied topically. Consequently, a numerical model of topical drug delivery for an aging human eye has been developed using commercial software {COMSOL} Multiphysics in the current study. Three different age groups (young, middle and old) have been considered and the changes in geometrical and tissue properties of different domains of the eye with age have been included in the numerical model. The effect of aging on heat transfer, aqueous humor flow, intraocular pressure and drug concentration in different domains and orientations of the eye have been investigated. Additionally, an attempt has been made to predict the best class of anti-glaucomatic treatment in silico that should be preferred to treat primary open-angle glaucoma effectively. Results illustrate that there is a decrease in the average corneal temperature and an in­ crease in the temperature deviation across the cornea with age. Further, there is a decrease in the aqueous humor flow magnitude in the anterior chamber of the eye and an increase in intraocular pressure in the anterior chamber of older age groups, which leads to primary open-angle glaucoma. The reduced aqueous humor flow leads to increased drug concentration in the anterior chamber as well as iris and reduced drug concentration in the trabecular mesh of the older age groups, thereby affecting the treatment efficacy. Additionally, our simulated results demonstrate that anti-glaucomatic treatments should be more focused on treating the trabecular mesh rather than the ciliary body of the eye.},

	abstract = {Abstract Computational modeling is an effective tool for the detection of eye abnormalities and a valuable assistant to hyperthermia treatments. In all these diagnoses and treatments, predicting the temperature distribution accurately is very important. However, the standard finite element method ({FEM}) currently used for such purposes has strong reliance on element meshes and the discretized system exhibits the so-called ‘overly stiff’ behavior. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper formulates an alpha finite element method (α{FEM}) to compute two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) bioheat transfer in the human eyes. The α{FEM} can produce much more accurate results using triangular (2D) and tetrahedron (3D) elements that can be generated automatically for complicated domains and hence is particularly suited for modeling human eyes. In the α{FEM}, a scaling factor α∈[0, 1] is introduced to combine the ‘overly stiff’ {FEM} model and ‘overly soft’ node-based finite element method ({NS}-{FEM}) model. With a properly chosen α, the α{FEM} can produce models with very ‘close-to-exact’ stiffness of the continuous system. Numerical results have shown that the present method gives much more accurate results compared with the standard {FEM} and the {NS}-{FEM}. Copyright 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	title = {Modeling of drug delivery to the human eye},
	abstract = {The human eye can mainly be divided into two chambers in numerical modeling: anterior and the posterior lobes. The treatments for diseases in each of these sections differ. For instance, the posterior segment, being more inward involves highly invasive treatments such as surgery, whereas anterior eye diseases rely on topical drug applications. Even though it appears to be complicated, surgery can assure the direct and efficient drug delivery. Delivery of a necessary amount of topically applied drugs to the targeted site in the anterior lobe of the eye can depend on multiple factors including the temperature profile, anatomy of the sub segments as well as the fluid flow rate in the eye. In the current study, the drug transportation in the anterior eye has been studied using numerical modeling. The model considers the spatio-temporal behavior of the drugs in towards the trabecular meshwork ({TM}), iris and the lens when applied to the corneal surface. The aqueous humor ({AH}) plays a major role in the drug delivery procedure through natural convection. These movements can depend on the temperature difference between the environment (surface of the eye) and the targeted eye segment. The current study has been able to depict the temporal drug concentrations changes in the {TM}, iris and the lens. These predictions display that the peak average drug concentration is found within one hour after application whereas it will be completely removed after five hours. Additionally, these concentrations depend on the temperature differences, for instance, the minimal peak concentration in the eye is observed when the temperature of the environment is the same as the ocular temperature.},

The temperature difference between the cornea and the iris (at core body temperature) causes circulation of the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber of the eye. Others have suggested that the circulation pattern governs the shape of the Krukenberg spindle, a distinctive vertical band of pigment on the posterior cornea surface in some pathologies. We modeled aqueous humor flow the human eye, treating the humor as a Boussinesq fluid and setting the corneal temperature based on infrared surface temperature measurements. The model predicts convection currents in the anterior chamber with velocities comparable to those resulting from forced flow through the gap between the iris and lens. When paths of pigment particles are calculated based on the predicted flow field, the particles circulate throughout the anterior chamber but tend to be near the vertical centerline of the eye for a greatest period of time. Further, the particles are usually in close proximity to the cornea only when they are near the vertical centerline. We conclude that the convective flow pattern of aqueous humor is consistent with a vertical pigment spindle.},

Fifty-four components of the oil were identified, representing 92.74\% of the oil. The main components were 2-methylbutanoic acid (21.50\%), 3-methylbutanoic acid (12.61\%), 2-methylpropanoic acid (8.99\%), methyl linoleate (8.76\%), methyl oleate (6.27\%), methyl palmitate (6.06\%), and 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid (5.74\%). Highly selective {COX}-2 inhibition was observed; at 50 microg/ml the oil inhibited 38.8\% of {COX}-2 activity.},

	abstract = {In this work, the concept of dual natural-norm for parametrized linear equations is used to derive residual-based a posteriori error bounds characterized by a O(1) stability constant. We translate these error bounds into very eﬀective practical a posteriori error estimators for reduced basis approximations and show how they can be eﬃciently computed following an oﬄine/online strategy. We prove that our practical dual natural-norm error estimator outperforms the classical inf-sup based error estimators in the self-adjoint case. Our ﬁndings are illustrated on anisotropic Helmholtz equations showing resonant behavior. Numerical results suggest that the proposed error estimator is able to successfully catch the correct order of magnitude of the reduced basis approximation error, thus outperforming the classical inf-sup based error estimator even for non self-adjoint problems.},
